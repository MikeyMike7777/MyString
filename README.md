# MyString
This project revolves around the creation of a "MyString" class, a custom re-implementation of the string construct in C++. 

This class emulates some of the standard C++ string library's core functionalities. It includes constructors, destructors, and overloaded operators for tasks like assignment, equality checking, and string concatenation. The project also provides memory management for the string content and features functions for input retrieval and length calculation. A test suite is incorporated to demonstrate and validate the MyString class's operations.
